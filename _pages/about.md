<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in System Science at the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pj7fXtgAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Citations"></a>.

My research interest includes: 
- *Broad Learning System*
- *Deep Learning*
- *Statistical Analysis and Prediction*
- *Natural Language Processing*

I helped my friends sort out the review material for the postgraduate entrance examination of "863 Probability & Mathematical Statistics" (*with few mistakes*). [[Download]](/pdf/概率论与数理统计.pdf)
